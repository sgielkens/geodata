1. Coordinates and desired observations have been read
2. Generated: 
     10 height differences
3. Noise has been added to observations                        
     mean distance = 14.783 m                                  
     mean randomly added to height differences     = -0.1928 mm
     st. dev. randomly added to height differences = 0.7234 mm 
4. Observations have been written to MOVE3-file
5. Coordinates have been written to MOVE3-file
6. Project file of MOVE3 has been written
7. End of programme
