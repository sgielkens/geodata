Dimension:     1D                                     
                                                      
1. Coordinates and desired observations have been read
2. Generated: 
     19 height differences
3. Noise has been added to observations                       
     mean distance = 2062.691 m                               
     mean randomly added to height differences     = 0.2895 mm
     st. dev. randomly added to height differences = 0.7510 mm
4. Observations have been written to MOVE3-file
5. Coordinates have been written to MOVE3-file
6. Project file of MOVE3 has been written
7. End of programme
