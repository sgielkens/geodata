1. Coordinates and desired observations have been read
2. Generated: 
     5 distances
     5 directions
3. Noise has been added to observations                   
     mean randomly added to distances     = -0.60526 mm   
     st. dev. randomly added to distances = 3.7256 mm     
     mean randomly added to directions     = -0.21089 mgon
     st. dev. randomly added to directions = 0.28401 mgon 
4. Observations have been written to MOVE3-file
5. Coordinates have been written to MOVE3-file
6. Project file of MOVE3 has been written
7. End of programme
