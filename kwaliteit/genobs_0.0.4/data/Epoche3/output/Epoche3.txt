Dimension:     2D                                     
                                                      
1. Coordinates and desired observations have been read
2. Generated: 
     5 distances
     5 directions
3. Noise has been added to observations                  
     mean randomly added to distances     = 0.59995 mm   
     st. dev. randomly added to distances = 2.0867 mm    
     mean randomly added to directions     = 0.27071 mgon
     st. dev. randomly added to directions = 0.23651 mgon
4. Observations have been written to MOVE3-file
5. Coordinates have been written to MOVE3-file
6. Project file of MOVE3 has been written
7. End of programme
