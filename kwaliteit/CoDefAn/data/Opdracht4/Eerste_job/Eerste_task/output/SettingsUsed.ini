[adjustment]

>= coordinate input:
>= -   WithCovarMatrix
>= -       WithCovarMatrix: covariance matrix is taken from a
>= -       file with extension .var or .covar, which is a file
>= -       exported by MOVE3 in the Illwerke format
>= -   NoCovarMatrix
>= -       NoCovarMatrix: standard deviations, and correlations
>= -       between the x-, y-, z-coordinate of a point, are taken
>= -       from a text file, and the covariance matrix contains,
>= -       therefore, a limited number of non-zero elements.
>= -       The matrix is multiplied by a variance factor (sigma
>= -       squared)
>= 
>= sigma:
>= -   square root of the variance factor; used only with
>= -   "coordinate input = NoCovarMatrix"
>= 
>= adjustment method:
>= -   options: A, B, P, PB
>= -   A is via A-model and an amplified cofactor matrix
>= -   B is via B-model
>= -   P is via Pandora box matrix
>= -   PB is iteriation via Pandora box matrix, and testing via B-model
>= 
>= stop criterion:
>= -   iteration of adjustment is stopped if absolute value of
>= -   maximum correction to parameters is smaller than stop criterion
>= 
>= itermax:
>= -   maximum number of adjustment iterations
>= 
>= time related point noise:
>= -   base standard deviation of all deformation constraints
>= -   it may be specified as:
>= -   = xy 0.5 mm z 1 mm (with 0.5 and 1 just examples, xy means
>= planimetry, and z means height)
>= -   = xy 0.0005 z 0.001 (unit is meter, if it is not specified)
>= -   = xy 0.5 mm (sufficient for 2D, for 3D z is assumed to be 0)
>= -   = 0.0005 (both xy and z are assumed to be 0.5 mm)
>= -   allowed units besides mm are cm and km.

[output]

>= Options: what will appear on the output-listing?
>= 
>= transformation parameters:
>= -   1: they appear
>= -   0: they do not appear
>= 
>= general test:
>= -   1: an overall model test (F-test) is performed
>= -   0: an overall model test (F-test) is not performed
>= 
>= w-test:
>= -   1: conventional w-tests are performed
>= -   0: conventional w-tests are not performed
>= Several types of w-tests are performed:
>= -   w-tests of coordinates: x, y and z separately
>= -   w-tests of transformation constraints
>= -   w-tests of deformation constraints
>= 
>= Conventional point tests:
>= -   1: conventional point tests are performed
>= -   0: conventional point tests are not performed
>= Conventional point tests are performed per epoch. Only one
>= point is assumed to be dislocated, but only in one epoch.
>= All points in all epochs are tested in this way.
>= 
>= mdb conventional point tests:
>= -   1: MDBs of conventional point tests are computed
>= -   0: MDBs of conventional point tests are not computed
>= MDB stands for Minimal Detectable Bias
>= 
>= tests of special deformations:
>= -   1: special deformation hypotheses are tested
>= -   0: special deformation hypotheses are not tested
>= The testing of special deformation hypotheses is performed using
>= the sections [deformation], see below

[points]

>= A point in a certain epoch can be renamed to detach it from
>= points with the same name (the same point) in other epochs.
>= Remove >= from the line with the command "rename point" and
>= enter the epoch and point numbers, where:
>= -   <e> is the epoch number
>= -   <p_old> is the old point number
>= -   <p_new> is the new point number
>= There may be more than one line with the command "rename point"
>= 
>= rename point = epoch <e> old <p_old> new <p_new>

[Special deformation hypotheses]

>= Tests of shift of several points through several epochs.
>= The first epoch is indicated by "begin epoch" and
>= the last epoch by "end epoch".
>= 
>= Each section [deformation] specifies one special
>= deformation hypothesis
>= 
>= For now, for "type", "hypothesis" and "behaviour" the
>= only options are:
>= -   type       = shift
>= -   hypothesis = true
>= -   behaviour  = constant velocity
